## Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install. Usually this is `~/.node-red`
```
npm install node-red-contrib-cameo
```

## Using

You can either setup node via editor or with a payload like the following example:

```
msg.payload = {
    device_type:"par64can_q_8w_bs",
    address_start:1,
    channels:"7channels",
    master_dimmer:0,
    stroboscope:0,
    red:0,
    green:0,
    blue:0,
    white:0,
    color_macro:0
};

```

While configuring node via editor you can specify "-1" as a value for any channel. In that case channel value doesn't change.
